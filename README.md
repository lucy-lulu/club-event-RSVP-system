## About the Project

In this subject, we aim to develop an application that will be used by Students at The University of
Melbourne to manage on-campus student clubs and events. Students can use the application to RSVP
to events hosted by Student Clubs. An example of a Student Club is the Computing and Information
Systems Student Association (CISSA). Student Clubs you create in the application don’t have to mimic
any existing university clubs.
